This repository houses the code for parameterising the end to end
ecosystem model strathE2E for St Peter and St Paul rocks off Brazil (South Mid-Atlantic Ridge). 
Scripts are loosely classified into families
-*bathymetry*-*fish*-*flows*-*nemo-medusa*-*saltless*-*StrathE2E*. R scripts
and Figures are self-explanatory directories.

This work is part of Mission Atlantic. Other Mission Atlantic (MA.) 
repositories cover StrathE2E parameterisations for other geographical areas.
The in house R packages used for these projects (*MiMeMo.tools*, *nemomedusR*, *slabR*)
were developed under the MiMeMo project.

This repository contains ongoing research - Do not use or share any material without prior consent from the authors.
